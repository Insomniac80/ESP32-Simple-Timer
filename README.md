# ESP32-Simple-Timer
Provides a simple timer class for ESP32, ESP8266 and other microcontrollers

Since working with millis() is rather clumsy and not well readable, this class was created. 

See the code of the example file, which should clarify many questions. 

For details the .hpp file is generously commented.
